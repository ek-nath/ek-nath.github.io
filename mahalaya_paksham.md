# Mahalaya Paksham

Explanation and importance of doing Tarpanam on each of the Tithi

**Mahalaya** refers to come in large groups. This denotes the period when our ancestors come together.  **Paksham** means 15 days. **Mahalaya Paksham** is when our ancestors come together for a period of 15 days.

This period begins on the Tamil Month Purattasi on the first day after Purnima (Full moon) and extends till the successive Amavasya (New moon). The Amavasya of the Purattasi month is known as *Mahalaya Paksham*. This is considered more auspicious than *Thai Amavasya* or *Aadi Amavasya*.

Generally *Tarpanam* is done on the occasion of Amavasya on each month. But during Mahalaya Paksham, tarpanam is done from the first day (Prathama tithi) till Amavasya (Last day of the paksham)

On this auspicious day, we remember all our ancestors. We do Snana and pray for their peace of their soul(Aatma). And One must donate clothes to Brahmins, food to the poor and aid the unprivileged who are deprived of education.

It is important to remember our Ancestors. This practice must be taught to our children. The names of the current generation must be written or preserved in a Diary so that religious practices such as Shraddha, Tarpanam continue in the future.
The following benefits of Doing Tarpanam are given below:
