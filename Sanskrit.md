Son: "Father, the government has sent you a letter"
Father: "What's it about?"
Son: "The government wants to recognize your dedication towards Sanskrit. They want you to fill out a form and respond"
Father: "Send a thank-you letter to the government. And write that, it isn't me who has served Sanskrit, it is the other way around. Sanskrit has done a favor for me, while I have done no "favor" on it. If the government truly feels the need to recognize anyone's effort then let them present these awards to those students who still have faith in this dying language"
